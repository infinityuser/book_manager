The program implements a book manager. One can:

1. create, read (by id, title), update (by id), and delete (by id) books
2. create, read (by id, name), update (by id), and delete (by id) users 
3. bind a book to a user after getting the user by id.

In order to select all the users or the books, type none in the search line and press the button "search"
